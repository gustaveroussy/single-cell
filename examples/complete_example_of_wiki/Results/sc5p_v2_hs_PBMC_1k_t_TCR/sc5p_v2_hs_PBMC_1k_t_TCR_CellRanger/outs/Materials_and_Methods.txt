Raw BCL-files were demultiplexed and converted to Fastq format using bcl2fastq (version 2.20.0.422 from Illumina).
Reads quality control was performed using fastqc (version 0.11.9) and assignment to the expected genome species evaluated with fastq-screen (version 0.14.0).
CellRanger (version 3.1.0 from 10X Genomics) was used to generate single-cell V(D)J sequences and annotations.
