Raw BCL-files were demultiplexed and converted to Fastq format using bcl2fastq (version 2.20.0.422 from Illumina).
Reads quality control was performed using fastqc (version 0.11.9) and assignment to the expected genome species evaluated with fastq-screen (version 0.14.0).
Reads were pseudo-mapped to the Ensembl reference transcriptome v99 corresponding to the homo sapiens GRCH38 build with kallisto (version 0.46.2) using its 'bus' subcommand and parameters corresponding to the 10X Chromium 5' scRNA-Seq v2 chemistry. The index was made with the kb-python (version 0.24.4) wrapper of kallisto. Barcode correction using whitelist provided by the manufacturer (10X Genomics) and gene-based reads quantification was performed with BUStools (version 0.40.0).
