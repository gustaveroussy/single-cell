QC reads, Pseudo-mapping and quantification
Raw BCL-files were demultiplexed and converted to Fastq format using bcl2fastq (version 2.20.0.422 from Illumina).Reads quality control was performed using fastqc (version 0.11.9) and assignment to the expected genome species evaluated with fastq-screen (version 0.14.0).Reads were pseudo-mapped to the Ensembl reference transcriptome v99 corresponding to the homo sapiens GRCH38 build with kallisto (version 0.46.2) using its 'bus' subcommand and parameters corresponding to the 10X Chromium 5' scRNA-Seq v2 chemistry. The index was made with the kb-python (version 0.24.4) wrapper of kallisto. Barcode correction using whitelist provided by the manufacturer (10X Genomics) and gene-based reads quantification was performed with BUStools (version 0.40.0).

QC data on each sample
Cell barcode by symbol count table were loaded in R (version 4.0.4) using the BUSpaRse package (version 1.5.3). To call real cells from empty droplets, we used the emptyDrops() function from the dropletUtils package (version 1.10.3), which assesses whether the RNA content associated with a cell barcode is significantly distinct from the ambient background RNA present within each sample. Barcodes with p-value < 0.001 (Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected) were considered as legitimate cells for further analysis.
The count matrix was filtered to exclude genes detected in less than 5 cells, cells with less than 1000 UMIs or less than 200 detected genes, as well as cells with mitochondrial transcripts proportion higher than 15%.The proportion of ribosomal gene counts and the proportion of mechanical stress-response gene counts (Thesis of Léo Machado entitled « From skeletal muscle stem cells to tissue atlases: new tools to investigate and circumvent dissociation-induced stress», 2019) were also estimated but not used to filter cells. Cell cycle scoring of each cell was performed using two methods: the CellcycleScoring() function from the Seurat package (version 4.0.0), and the cyclone() function from Scran (version 1.18.5).Barcodes corresponding to doublet cells were identified and discarded using the union of two methods: scDblFinder (version 1.4.0) using default parameters, and scds (version 1.6.0) with its hybrid method using default parameters. We manualy verified that the cells identified as doublets did not systematically correspond to cells in G2M phase.

Individual analysis
Seurat (version 4.0.0) was applied for further data processing. The SCTransform normalization method (Hafemeister C, Satija R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression. Genome Biol. 2019;20 10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1.) was used to normalize, scale, select 3000 Highly Variable Genes.The number of PCA dimensions to keep for further analysis was evaluated by assessing a range of reduced PCA spaces using 3 to 49 dimensions, with a step of 2. For each generated PCA space, Louvain clustering of cells was performed using a range of values for the resolution parameter from 0.1 to 1.2 with a step of 0.1. The optimal space was manually evaluated as the one combination of kept dimensions and clustering resolution resolving the best structure (clusters homogeneity and compacity) in a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection space (UMAP). Additionaly, we used the clustree method (version 0.4.3) to assess if the selected optimal space corresponded to a relatively stable position in the clustering results tested for these dimensions / resolution combinations.
An automatic annotation of cell types was perfom by SingleR (version 1.4.1) (with fine-tuning step) and ClustifyR (version 1.3.3), using packages built-in references. It labels clusters (or cells) from a dataset based on similarity (Spearman correlation score) to a reference dataset with known labels. The labels with a correlation score greater than 0.25 for SingleR or greater than 0.35 for ClustifyR were kept.Marker genes for Louvain clusters were identified through a «one versus others» differential anaylisis using the Wilcoxon test through the FindAllMarkers() function from Seurat, considering only genes with a minimum log fold-change of 0.5 in at least 75% of cells from one of the groups compared, and FDR-adjusted p-values <0.05 (Benjaminin-Hochberg method).

Cell surface proteins (CITE-seq ADT)
Raw BCL-files were demultiplexed and converted to Fastq format using bcl2fastq (version 2.20.0.422 from Illumina).Reads quality control was performed using fastqc (version 0.11.9) and assignment to the expected genome species evaluated with fastq-screen (version 0.14.0).A customized index, with the correspondance between synthetic DNA-transcripts and tagged protein names, was made with the kb-python (version 0.24.4) wrapper of kallisto. Reads were pseudo-mapped to the customized index with kallisto (version 0.46.2) using its 'bus' subcommand and parameters corresponding to the 10X Chromium 5' scRNA-Seq v2 chemistry. Barcode correction using whitelist provided by the manufacturer (10X Genomics) and gene-based reads quantification was performed with BUStools (version 0.40.0). Only cell barcodes corresponding to the cell barcodes of gene expression were kept. Counting table was log-normalize (NormalizeData() function from Seurat with normalization.method parameters setting to 'LogNormalize') and ploted on UMAP near corresponding gene expression. Spearman correlation scores beetween protein levels and gene expression levels was computed.

Single-cell immune profiling (TCR)
 The annotation was merged with corresponding cell barcode of 5’ gene expression. The scRepertoire package (version 1.1.2) was used to process annotation to assign clonotype based on TCR chains. scRepertoire allows to study contig quantification, contig abundance, contig length, clonal space homeostasis, clonal proportion, clonal overlap beetween clusters and diversity. Physicochemical properties of the CDR3, based on amino-acid sequences, was determined by the alakazam R package (version 1.1.0).
