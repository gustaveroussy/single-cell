Grouped analysis
Seurat (version 4.0.0) was applied for further data processing. Each dataset was normalized independently by SCTransform, as described in the Individual Analysis section, then data were merged using the merge() function from Seurat and a common dimension reduction was performed by PCA.The number of PCA dimensions to keep for further analysis was evaluated by assessing a range of reduced PCA spaces using 3 to 100 dimensions, with a step of 2. For each generated PCA space, Louvain clustering of cells was performed using a range of values for the resolution parameter from 0.1 to 1.2 with a step of 0.1. The optimal space was manually evaluated as the one combination of kept dimensions and clustering resolution resolving the best structure (clusters homogeneity and compacity) in a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection space (UMAP). Additionaly, we used the clustree method (version 0.4.3) to assess if the selected optimal space corresponded to a relatively stable position in the clustering results tested for these dimensions / resolution combinations.
An automatic annotation of cell types was perfom by SingleR (version 1.4.1) (with fine-tuning step) and ClustifyR (version 1.3.3), using packages built-in references. It labels clusters (or cells) from a dataset based on similarity (Spearman correlation score) to a reference dataset with known labels. The labels with a correlation score greater than 0.25 for SingleR or greater than 0.35 for ClustifyR were kept.Marker genes for Louvain clusters were identified through a «one versus others» differential anaylisis using the Wilcoxon test through the FindAllMarkers() function from Seurat, considering only genes with a minimum log fold-change of 0.5 in at least 75% of cells from one of the groups compared, and FDR-adjusted p-values <0.05 (Benjaminin-Hochberg method).

Cell surface proteins (CITE-seq ADT)
Raw BCL-files were demultiplexed and converted to Fastq format using bcl2fastq (version 2.20.0.422 from Illumina).Reads quality control was performed using fastqc (version 0.11.9) and assignment to the expected genome species evaluated with fastq-screen (version 0.14.0).A customized index, with the correspondance between synthetic DNA-transcripts and tagged protein names, was made with the kb-python (version 0.24.4) wrapper of kallisto. Reads were pseudo-mapped to the customized index with kallisto (version 0.46.2) using its 'bus' subcommand and parameters corresponding to the 10X Chromium 5' scRNA-Seq v2 chemistry. Barcode correction using whitelist provided by the manufacturer (10X Genomics) and gene-based reads quantification was performed with BUStools (version 0.40.0). Only cell barcodes corresponding to the cell barcodes of gene expression were kept. Counting table was log-normalize (NormalizeData() function from Seurat with normalization.method parameters setting to 'LogNormalize') and spearman correlation scores beetween proteins levels and genes expression levels was computed and ploted on UMAP.

Single-cell immune profiling (TCR)
 The annotation was merged with corresponding cell barcode of 5’ gene expression. The scRepertoire package (version 1.1.2) was used to process annotation to assign clonotype based on TCR chains. scRepertoire allows to study contig quantification, contig abundance, contig length, clonal space homeostasis, clonal proportion, clonal overlap beetween clusters and diversity. Physicochemical properties of the CDR3, based on amino-acid sequences, was determined by the alakazam R package (version 1.1.0).

Cerebro
Cerebro (version 1.3.1), cell report browser, is an AppShiny which allows users to interactively visualize various parts of single cell transcriptomics analysis without requiring bioinformatics expertise. This package is also used to identify most expressed genes, and to compute pathway enrichment on marker genes (based on the Enrichr API) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (uses the Gene Set Variation Analysis method in combination with additional statistics as published by Diaz-Mejia et. al.(Diaz-Mejia JJ, Meng EC, Pico AR et al.
