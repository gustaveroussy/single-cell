Raw BCL-files were demultiplexed and converted to Fastq format using bcl2fastq (version 2.20.0.422 from Illumina).
Reads quality control was performed using fastqc (version 0.11.9) and assignment to the expected genome species evaluated with fastq-screen (version 0.14.0).
A customized index, with the correspondance between synthetic DNA-transcripts and tagged protein names, was made with the kb-python (version 0.24.4) wrapper of kallisto. Reads were pseudo-mapped to the customized index with kallisto (version 0.46.2) using its 'bus' subcommand and parameters corresponding to the 10X Chromium 5' scRNA-Seq v2 chemistry. Barcode correction using whitelist provided by the manufacturer (10X Genomics) and gene-based reads quantification was performed with BUStools (version 0.40.0).
